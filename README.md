# Experiment Execution Guide

This project was designed to be executed in a **GPU-enabled environment**. To ensure reproducibility and ease of setup, **all experiments were conducted using Google Colab via `main.ipynb`**.

---

## 🚀 Recommended: Run on Google Colab (GPU)

### Dataset

- The `data.zip` file can be downloaded from **Google Drive**:  
  👉 [**data.zip**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10b1yPJOOsW2nCoZcNUPlVIDjccWcax_o/view?usp=drive_link)

### Steps

1. Unzip the provided `data.zip` file.
2. Upload the extracted data folder to **Google Drive**.
3. Open [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb) in **Google Colab** and run all cells sequentially.

> ⚠️ Make sure that Colab is set to use a **GPU runtime** (`Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU`).
